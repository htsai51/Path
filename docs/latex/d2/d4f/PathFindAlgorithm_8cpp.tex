\subsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of class Path\-Find\-Algorithm methods. This file implements methods in base class of Path\-Find\-Algorithm.

Path\-Find\-Algorithm is the base class for path finding algorithm. It supports building map/graph into nodes, edges for computing shortest path, reconstructing path from goal to start, and displaying map with or without shortest path on screen.
